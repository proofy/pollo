Pollo is an XML editor.

For more information see the online documentation at
http://pollo.sourceforge.net

Pollo is an open-source project with a very liberal license.
This means a lot more than just giving the source away for free,
and you as a user sitting back and anxiously awaiting the next
release. We welcome your participation, being it patches, questions,
comments, remarks, documentation enhancements or feature requests.
