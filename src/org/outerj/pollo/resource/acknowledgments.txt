 - Pollo uses the following third-party libraries:
    - Apache's Xerces for XML Parsing and it's DOM implementation.
      (Xerces' support for mutation events is essential to Pollo).
    - Log4j for logging (not used much yet).
    - Sun's excellent Multi Schema Validator (MSV) for support of
      XML Schema, RELAX-NG, DTD, etc.
    - Jaxen to evaluate XPath expressions.
    - XPP pull parser for reading configuration files
    - Jakarta Commons Lang for nested exceptions.

   See the online help for the licenses of these libraries.

 - The look with the panels is inspired by Eclipse. It was
   the demo by Karsten Lentzsch (http://www.jgoodies.com/metamorphosis)
   that brought me to that idea, and other GUI improvements.

 - the tree view was originally inspired by conglomerate:
