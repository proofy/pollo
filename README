How to run Pollo:

- Make sure you have a recent JDK (or JRE) from the 1.3 or 1.4 series installed.
  You can download one from http://java.sun.com/getjava/

  I have only tested with Sun JDK's (Windows/Linux).

- If the path to the java executable is in the PATH environment variable, you
  can start pollo by executing the pollo.sh (for Linux) or pollo.bat (for Windows)
  commands.

  If java is not in your PATH, you'll have to modify the startup scripts.
 

How to build Pollo source (when using source download/CVS)
  - Install Apache Jakarta Ant (http://jakarta.apache.org)
  - type "ant" in the pollo directory
  - start pollo in the usual way
