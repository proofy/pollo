version 0.4
===========
 This version has been possible through the kind sponsering by Infobjects.

 - A new, more classic, tree view has been introduced next to Pollo's special
   colorful treeview. The type of tree to be used is specified as
   part of the display specification, but can be overridden by the user.
 - Support more options in the display specifications:
    - for elements and attributes, a label can be defined to be shown
      instead of the real element name
    - for elements and attributes, the text color to display them
      can be defined.
    - for elements, an icon to be shown can be specified. By
      default a box-icon colored in the element's background color
      is shown.
    - for elements and attributes, help texts can be defined.

   The XML format of the display specifications has been changed without
   maintaining backwards compatibility. There is an utility class
   that can convert the old format to the new one, it is called
   DisplaySpecificationToZeroDotFour. If you need help on using
   this, just ask on the mailing list.

 - Added "Close All" and "Close All Except This" actions to the file menu.
 - Made the splitpane containing the node editor and help panel
   "one touch expandable".
 - Added context menu on the file tabs containing "Close view" and
   "Close All Except This" options.
 - Made the size of the undo stack configurable through the user preferences
   dialog (previously it was always unlimitted). Default is 50.
 - handle corrupted .pollorc file gracefully
 - don't do text-wrapping when saving a file
 - Added a Cocoon 2.1 sitemap schema & display spec. This is only
   a first go at it. It includes the following changes: addition of
   map:flow, map:script, map:pipes, map:pipe, map:call/@function,
   map:call/@continuation, map:act/@name, map:match/@name,
   map:generate/@hint, map:transform/@hint, map:serialize/@hint,
   map:redirect-to/@global, map:redirect-to/@permanent,
   map:component-configuration. I've also added help texts here and
   there, but currently only a very small number of elements and
   attributes have them.
 - removed the display specification editor tool, which was only
   an experiment. There is now a view-type for editing the
   display specfication files.
 - When using a DTD as schema, required attributes have an exclamation
   mark next to them in the attribute editor.
 - Upgraded MSV to nightly build of October 2, 2003. Thanks to Gregory Davis.
 - The pollo.sh script is now executable from everywhere, you don't
   have to be in the 'pollo/bin' directory. Thanks to Gregory Davis.
 - This release should work on Java 1.3 again
 - all kind of miscellaneous small stuff

version 0.3.6
=============
 - Made pollo.bat work on older Windows versions (such as Windows 98)
 - Added an editor for editing display specification files. I've created
   this only for the fun of it, mainly for writing the color-selector.
   If you'd like to see it improved, consider contributing!
 - Added simple search functionality in text-mode, kindly contributed by
   Roger I Martin.

version 0.3.5
=============
FEATURES
 - Some initial user preferences: you can now change the fonts
   used in the treeview by selecting File | User Preferences.
   I get good effects putting element and attribute names to a bold,
   non-italic font.
BUG FIXES
 - changed shortcut for toggle expand/collapse to control space
   instead of just space, since otherwise pressing space in the
   editor for text nodes also invoked this action.
 - when changing text view to tree view in the dropdown, and the switch
   to tree view failed, then tree view stayed incorrectly selected
   in the dropdown
 - The action 'Show Content Model' never worked.

version 0.3.4
=============
 - Fixed serious memory leaks (after closing  a file, the resources
   used up by the file were not released).
 - Integrated a patch by Roger I Martin to allow copy during drag-and-drop
   (press ctrl and then drag), and to automatically switch tabs when you
   move over them while dragging.
 - Because of a clipping bug in Java (most visible in version 1.4, see
   the java bugparade nr. 4265778), the element shapes were drawed
   incorrectly in (very) large files. This is fixed now by letting Pollo
   clip the largest part of the shape itself.
 - Some new keyboard navigations contributed by Curt Thompson.
 - Accelerator and mnemonic keys for the menus, contributed by Scott Willy.
   This is part of his ongoing effort to i18n-ize pollo.
 - updated Cocoon sitemap schema, it now corresponds to cocoon 2.02
 - added a new feature to the pollo schema format and the
   displayspecification: it is now possible to describe the element
   based on its parent element. E.g. in the cocoon sitemap, a map:act
   element has other attributes depending on its context.
 - The menu for recently used files wasn't accessible using arrow keys
 - Enhanced the attribute editor: when selecting a value from a dropdown,
   and there are additional buttons (like for cocoon), then the additional
   buttons are now to the left of the dropdown button.
   The keyboard in the attribute editor should now work
   as one would expect (F2 to start editing cell, ...).
   Only cells in the second column are selectable.
 - Elements can now be selected by clicking on their left bar.
 - A file passed as a command line argument will be opened automatically.
 - Use system line separator when saving files.
 - Use Aqua Look And Feel on OS X, due to Richard Bounds
 - DTD's referenced in DOCTYPE's are no never loaded. Moved to Xerces 2
   to make this possible.
 - Render entity-reference nodes (no possibility to create them yet -- if
   anyone needs this, let me know).
 - Pressing escape moves focus back to the main editor widget.
 - Default encoding when saving in text view is now UTF-8, as it should be
 - Included a schema for Ant 1.5
 - Removed the JavaHelp system, the content will now be on Pollo's website.
   This will make it easier to update, and easier to read.
 - Changed the icons to the default Java L&F icons, because the ones
   I was using previously are now covered by GPL.

version 0.3.3
=============
 - Added support for various schema languages through Sun's Multi Schema
   Validator (XML Schema, RELAX-NG, and others are supported). The boxes
   for selecting elements just show all elements allowed as child of their
   parent elements, they don't take in account all features of the content
   model (might come in a later version).
   You can view the precise allowed content model though using the menu option
   Schema -> Show Content Model. It is of course also possible to validate
   the document against the schema in use (menu: Schema -> Validate).
   A lot of credit for this work goes to Al Byers, who got me started on
   this.
 - The dialog box for selecting the view type is extended so that
   you can choose the schema to use etc. These settings cannot be saved
   yet however.
   I added some info in the online help about how to add new view types
   in pollo's configuration file.
 - The welcome dialog box has been dropped, it is now possible to open
   multiple files in one window with a tabbed interface. It is still
   possible to create multiple windows and mulitple views on the same
   file. It's a bit like in Mozilla and Opera.
 - There's a cool new action plugin framework: it is possible to write
   plugins that provide additional actions under an action menu.
   Once again inspired by Al Byers.
 - In many situations pollo didn't provide a parent frame when showing modal
   dialog boxes, which could lead to trouble when a modal dialog box
   dissappaerd under the main frame (especially in Windows). A lot of these
   situations should now be fixed.
 - Added some initial online help.
 - Added menu with recently opened files (the list is stored in the .pollorc
   in your home directory)
 - It is not longer possible to open the same file more than one time.
 - Added a toolbar, moved the text/tree mode switch over there, because
   otherwise there would be tabs inside tabs.
 - JDK 1.4 compatible (wheelmouse!) I noticed though that on Windows, the
   cursor is sometimes not visible in text mode.
 - position of split panes and window size are stored in user configuration
 - untitled files are now numbered so that it's possible to distinguish them
 - new Cocoon stuff: attribute editor plugin with support for browsing files
   and inserting references to patterns in wildcard URI matchers. Plugin
   actions (see 'Plugin Actions' menu) to quickly go to a matcher pattern,
   to go to a component declaration, and to open the file referenced by a
   src attribute.
 - updated Ant schema to Ant 1.4.1
 - some GUI tweaking (split panes made nicer, text aligned in menus).

version 0.3.2
=============
 - for attributes for which a choicelist is available, an arrow is
   drawn so that you can easily see which attributes have choicelists.
 - the text view is now editable:
    - each time you switch back to the tree view, the dom tree is rebuild,
      as is the tree view itself.
    - the text editor doesn't (yet) provide any advanced functionality,
      such as automatic indenting or element name popups.
    - non-well-formed files can now also be opened, these will be displayed
      in text view by default, and you can't switch to tree view until
      the xml is well-formed. When opening a file this way, the character
      encoding isn't yet correctly determined, the java default is used.
    - when saving a file while in text mode, Pollo will use the encoding
      defined in the "<?xml" declaraction.
 - The cocoon special mode is not available anymore, it will return in
   a later release when there will be a plugin framework.
 - The menubar now contains commands that were previously only available
   with the context menu.
 - tuned the sizes of the panels in the splitpanes
 - in the dialog for choosing the type of view, double click on the list
   is now supported.
 - Some buttons, like the ones on the XPath query panel, cannot get
   focus anymore, leaving the focus wherever it was before you pressed
   the button.
 - Added a bar displaying the XPath path to the currently selected node
   (also works when selecting attributes).

version 0.3.1
=============
 - when a character data node (text, comment, cdata, pi) is collapsed,
   draw the first line of text.
 - Two new types of nodes supported:
    - the document node: this allows that nodes before and after the
      document element (comments and pi's) are now also visible/editable.
    - processing instructions. This is actually a special case of character
      data nodes.
 - the view can now be rendered to a file: just right click on any node
   and select the 'Store as image...' option. Only saving as jpeg is
   supported, as this is the only format support by jdk 1.3 (jdk 1.4
   will also support other formats such as png).
 - wrote the basic code to manage a user-preferences file. The preferences
   file is stored in the user home directory and is named ".pollorc".
 - if a file is changed, a * is shown in front of its name in the
   titlebar (thanks to Steven Noels for the suggestion).
 - the last path used in the file-open dialog is now remembered,
   and written to the user preferences file (thanks to Steven Noels for the
   suggestion).
 - changed the order of the of the Execute and '?' (examples) buttons next to
   the xpath query field. Pressing enter executes the query. (suggestions
   made by Steven Noels).
 - added a schema and template for XSL:FO (in cooperation with Steven Noels).
 - Added a 'View Source' feature (read only)
 - Upgraded jaxen to a version I pulled out of the jaxen cvs repository.

version 0.3
===========
 - Added keyboard support, see the Help->About for an overview
   of the keybindings.
 - All attributes of an element are now rendered, regardless of
   whether they are specified in the display specification or not.
   Attributes that are defined in the display specification are
   first shown (in the same order as they appear in the displayspec),
   then the remaining attributes are shown.
 - Changed the format of the Pollo configuration file to XML instead
   of java properties format. Use apache common's digester to build
   an object structure from it.
 - Defined interfaces for display specifications and schemas and
   for their factories. These factories are now specified in the
   Pollo configuration file per viewtype, so that other implementations
   can be used for other filetypes. Added generic implementations
   of the display specification and schema which can be used for
   XML files not explicitely supported by Pollo. Also made an implementation
   of them which chains a number of other display specifications/schemas.
   This will allow to support file types using mixed schemas,
   such as WSDL containing XML Schema.
 - Added the possibility to create plugins for editing attribute values.
   These plugins can be chained, meaning that if the first plugin
   doesn't return an editor for attribute, then the next plugin is
   asked for one, and so on. Also included is an example plugin for
   Ant, that allows to select property names from a dialog.
 - Added support for executing XPath queries. If the result of the
   query is a list of nodes, you can jump between the nodes. If the
   result is a not a node, it is shown in a dialog box.
 - Use jaxen instead of xalan for executing xpath queries.
 - Added support for templates. A template is implemented by a Java
   class that must generate a dom tree. Currently included is an
   implementation that parses a file, but any code that generates
   a DOM could be used. The templates must be defined in the Pollo
   configuration file.
 - show a red border around the component that has keyboard focus.
 - the list with the elements now require to double click on an element
   to insert it. Alternatively, you can select one an then press enter.
 - when dropping a node on a location where its not allowed (according
   to the schema in use), it is now asked if you want to insert it anyway.
 - removed a bug where the tree could get distored when undoing
   the insertion/removal of a node in a part of the tree that
   was collapsed.
 - Added an 'insert unlisted element' item to the lists with elements.
 - stripping whitespace text nodes did not work in the presence
   of a DTD. Thanks to Ross Burton for reporting this.
 - disabled use of Kunstoff look and feel. It can look ugly on certain
   JDK's. Will make this user-configurable in the next version.
 - Changed splash screen logo to something that better fits with the season.
 - started using log4j in some places. Still needs more work.
 - after deleting a node, move the focus to the next node
 - and any other stuff I forgot to mention...

version 0.2
===========
 - rendering/editing of comment nodes, text nodes, cdata nodes
 - comment out / uncomment
 - text clipping (append '...' if text doesn't fit on the screen)
 - opening multiple files, multiple views on same file
 - replacement of elementdragpanel with nodeinsertionpanel
 - on parsing, all textnodes that only contain whitespace are removed.
   (this is not conformant with the xml spec since only when a schema is
   present, the application can really know what whitespace is ignorable).
   On saving, the XML is indented again (todo: make this user-configurable).
 - save as
 - dropping on element onto itself or as a descendant of itself not allowed anymore
 - initial support for ant files (added an antschema.xml and antspec.xml,
   both files are automatically generated).
 - better indication of the selected node (using thick black border)
 - use mousePressed instead of mouseClicked event to select nodes (otherwise
   some clicks seemed to get lost)
 - a drag-and-drop can now be undone in one step (previously this required
   chosing undo twice). This is done by adding the concept of
   undo-transactions to the undo engine. Update: did the same for 'uncomment'
   and 'comment out' actions.
 - changes to attributes are applied directly to the DOM (no need to press
   the 'Apply changes' button anymore). There's now a clear visible
   distinction between an attribute with no value and one with has empty
   string as value. Attributes are alfabetically sorted.
 - collapse all/expand all
 - eliminated the use of the 'java.text.TextLayout' class, which has resulted
   in large speed improvements.
 - added about dialog with license information.
 - autoscroll when dragging
 - xpath expressions in the schema now resolve namespace prefixes to
   namespaces defined in the schema, rather than in the instance document.
 - and much more...

version 0.1
===========
 - save document in the same encodig as it's loaded (previsously this was always ISO-8859-1)
 - attributespanel is now disabled when no element is selected or after the selected element was removed
